# docker-honeypot

A Python-based, Docker-isolated honeypot prototype designed for understanding attacker behavior in a controlled environment. It spins up a fake shell interface inside a sandboxed Docker container with a decoy filesystem to trick and observe potential malicious activity.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an **experimental project**. Some features may be incomplete or insecure. Use at your own risk and never run this on production systems.
