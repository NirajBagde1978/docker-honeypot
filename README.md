# docker-honeypot
A Python, Docker-based honeypot(prototype) with isolated filesystem which is useful for the understanding the attacks of an attacker. It is just an prototype and some of the functionality is incomplete. By default as it is an prototype or experimental project the default IP and PORT number is 0.0.0.0 and 2222, you can change it as required.

for running the docker-honeypot project follow the steps
1) pip install .
2) docker-honeypot

Now for this program to work properly you need to have latest docker application installed. This program would be runned on the linux environment where the actual server would be present.
